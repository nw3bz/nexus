/**
 * Regression: Ruby mixin heritage resolution must work on the sequential
 * ingestion fallback AND the worker-pool path, with identical output.
 *
 * Guards the two Codex adversarial review findings addressed by plan
 * `docs/plans/2026-04-17-001-fix-codex-adversarial-ruby-mixin-heritage-plan.md`:
 *
 * 1. Sequential-mode `sequentialHeritageMap` must include Ruby `include` /
 *    `extend` / `prepend` mixin ancestry before `processCalls` resolves calls
 *    against it. `extractExtractedHeritageFromFiles` now also runs
 *    `heritageExtractor.extractFromCall` during its prepass.
 *
 * 2. Ruby `module` declarations are relabeled to `Trait` so they participate
 *    in `lookupClassByName` / `buildHeritageMap`.
 *
 * The follow-up plan `docs/plans/2026-04-17-002-fix-ce-review-ruby-mixin-followups-plan.md`
 * Units 1 and 2 harden this suite:
 *   - Worker mode actually spawns a worker pool (verified via
 *     `PipelineResult.usedWorkerPool`) instead of silently falling back.
 *   - The prepend-only `prepended_marker` assertion checks the resolved
 *     method's OWNER, so reverting the Module→Trait relabel (Unit 2 of
 *     plan 001) makes the test fail with a clear owner-mismatch instead
 *     of passing trivially on `Account`'s own method.
 *
 * Plan 003 adds the `'ruby-mixin'` MroStrategy and kind-aware ancestry
 * (prepend / include / extend split). The infrastructure is wired in
 * `lookupMethodByOwnerWithMRO` and applies whenever Ruby calls flow through
 * the owner-scoped `resolveMemberCall` path. Shadow-name assertion for
 * `call_serialize → PrependedOverride#serialize` is TODO-marked below because
 * Ruby bare-identifier calls inside methods (self-calls) currently take the
 * `resolveFreeCall` path which doesn't do MRO. See the TODO comment for detail.
 *
 * Known guard limitation (documented residual): reverting plan 001 Unit 1
 * alone (the sequential prepass extractFromCall) does NOT make these tests
 * fail, because `processCalls` independently extracts call-based heritage
 * into `rubyHeritage`, feeds it to `processHeritageFromExtracted` for graph
 * edges, and the call resolver's global-name fallback can still locate
 * mixin-provided methods without MRO ancestry. A stronger guard would need
 * an ambiguous method name that only MRO can disambiguate; that requires
 * cross-chunk or multi-class shadowing scenarios not covered by this
 * fixture. Tracked as residual work in plan 002's Unit 3 (cross-chunk).
